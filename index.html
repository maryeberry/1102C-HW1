    <p>Lately I've been watching a lot of movies during the pandemic. The most recent movies I watched were 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), The Green Knight (2021), and The Witch (2015). I really enjoyed all three. <br> When I can, I also go to concerts downtown alone to relax. However I just really spend a lot of time at home due to the pandemic.</p>
